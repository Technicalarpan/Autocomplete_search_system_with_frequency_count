# Autocomplete_search_system_with_frequency_count
Created an autocomplete search engine that predicts product names from user input. It monitors search frequency for every term and orders suggestions so that the most searched ones are listed first. It also supports fuzzy search based on Levenshtein edit distance to support typos and offer relevant suggestions even with errors in the query.
